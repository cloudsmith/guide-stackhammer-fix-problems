This repository contains puppet modules and manifests with a variety of errors/problems.
The purpose of the repository is to show how to analyze and fix problems.

* Circular module dependencies - module_a depends on module_b, which depends on module_a
* Implied dependency - logic in module_b, uses module_c without declaring the dependency
* Out of range dependency - module_a has constraint on version of module_c that is not satisfied
* Missing dependency - module_a has dependency on missing module cloudsmith/newrelic
* Simple syntax error - the file bogus.pp has if statement with missing 'then' part in { }
